# Number Histogram App
**Description:** In this program, an array is created with 25 elements. For each element in the array we are assigning a random number between 0 - 9. (results will be printed into the console)



## Objective:
A histogram represents the distribution of numerical data - essentially a count of the number of occurences of a particular piece of data. Write a program that creates a basic "number histogram".

First, create an array with 25 elements, like this (use this variable name):

`init[] data = new int[25];`

Using a for loop, change the value *at each index* in `data` to a randomly generated integer from 0 - 9. The `data` array should contain different values everytime your program runs.

![Instructions](https://github.com/Tanner1638/CodeHS-APCS-Java/blob/master/Sandbox%20Projects/ignore/Capture.PNG)
1. Create a new file in the sandbox and name it `Randomizer.java` then copy and paste the code as found in this repo called `Randomizer.java`.
2. Afterwards, copy and paste `MyProgram.java` into your `MyProgram.java`.
