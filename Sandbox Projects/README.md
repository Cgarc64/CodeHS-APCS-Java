# Number Histogram App

A histogram represents the distribution of numerical data - essentially a count of the number of occurences of a particular piece of data. Write a program that creates a basic "number histogram".

First, create an array with 25 elements, like this (use this variable name):
init[] data = new int[25];

Using a for loop, change the value *at each index* in `data` to a randomly generated integer from 0 - 9. The `data` array should contain different values everytime your program runs.
